# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI
A dynamic, user-friendly interface for managing users, roles, and permissions within a system. This project showcases the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing administrators to effectively manage user access and define role-specific permissions.

# Features

# 1. User Management

• View a list of users with details such as ID, Name, Email, Role, and Status.

• Add new users with a simple form for Name, Email, Role, and Status.

• Edit user details, including Name, Email, Role, and Status.

• Delete users from the system with confirmation prompts.

• Assign roles to users dynamically and toggle their status (Active/Inactive).

# 2. Role Management

• View existing roles with their associated permissions.

• Add new roles with customizable names and permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete).

• Edit roles to modify their names or update permissions dynamically.

• Delete roles from the system with safety checks.

# 3. Permission Management

• Assign and modify permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete) for each role.

• Clearly display current permissions for easy understanding and updates.

• Prevent role creation or modification without valid permissions to ensure security.

# 4. Dynamic UI

• Responsive and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.

•Dark mode toggle for improved accessibility.

•Sidebar toggle for better navigation on smaller screens.

# Technologies Used
• HTML: Structure of the web application.

• CSS: Styling for tables, forms, modals, dark mode, and responsive design.

• JavaScript:
